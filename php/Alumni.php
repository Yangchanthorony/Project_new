            The American University of Phnom Penh is a private university with a non-profit mission, founded using the supportive guidance and initiative 
            of experienced American educators. Our founders aspire to provide high-quality education to every student in Cambodia and across the Asian region 
            from its operation within the cultural heart of Southeast Asia.

            In 2021, PPIU has continued its rapid growth. There are now seven undergraduate programs and an MBA program. We are also proud to be the only 
            university in Cambodia to provide accredited international degrees through our dual-degree programs enabled by the generous efforts of our partner institutions: 
            the University of Arizona and Fort Hays State University.

            In 2017, we moved into our new state-of-the-art campus located in northern Phnom Penh, the robust capital of Cambodia. The city, as well as Cambodia in general, 
            is not only known for its rich history and culture but also for its friendly people.

            <p class="section-text">
            Whether you are a young scholar seeking to build your academic career, a veteran educator looking for ways to contribute, or anything in between, 
            PPIU will provide a supportive environment where you can succeed while contributing to the human resources development of Cambodia. 
            Furthermore, PPIU offers a competitive benefits package which includes round-trip airfare (conditions apply), a free visa, free work permit,
